TASK-DISTRIBUTOR
================

Task-Distributor is a collection of two bash scripts, which simplify the 
parallel generation of images by using the ray tracing software POV-Ray by using 
multiple worker nodes in parallel. POV-Ray supports to calculate just a part of 
the final image (a limited number of rows).
